# Lab 1 Team Contract

Work together with your team to write a team contract. This is something you should all agree on and contribute to.
Your team contract should include (but is not limited to):
- schedules and skills
- general meeting schedule
- assigning of roles and individual responsibilities
- how individuals will be held accountable
- how to handle conflict when it arises

## Other requirements

1. Markdown headers, links, and tables used meaningfully.
2. In the team contract, commit a screenshot of a `git push` or copy/paste the `git` terminal commands that were done.

## Turn in Instructions

1. Decide on **ONE** github repository to make commits to.  
2. Have at least 2 members make commits to the `README.md` to your team contract. 
3. Have 1 member send me the link to the repo.
