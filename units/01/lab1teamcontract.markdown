Work together with your team (2-3 people) to make an engaging jeopardy game.

## Requirements

- your game should equally about each of you (with 12 factual questions), and all of you must own at least one question per category (past, present, future). You can feature: important things about your identity, skills that each of you have, skills you are working towards, your biggest dreams. The questions should be factual and not opinion based, and not include you in them (e.g. What is Jane's favorite color? is not allowed, but asking What color is #ff00ff? is.).
- at least 3 questions with pictures; 1 picture must be stored locally in the repo. The others can be links to images on the web.
- everyone commiting to the same github repository.
- An updated README.md file that includes a screenshot of one `git push`. Please use command line or the git extension on VSCode to make your commits.

## Turn-in Instructions

1. Fork **ONE** [my jeopardy-talambuhay project](https://github.com/ifenghm/jeopardy-talambuhay.git)  github repository to make commits to.  
2. Have 1 member send me the link to the repo on Google Classroom.

## Presentations

- Each team will upload their game and host their game to the class (more details to come).
- After each question is answered, another team member will share a bit about the person and how this question relates to them.
- I am expecting that we all will learn something new about each other!
