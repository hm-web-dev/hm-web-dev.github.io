# Exercise: HTML

The [w3schools HTML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) is a great resource to start learning HTML. It's also a great place to look for
HTML documentation!

## Questions

1. What does HTML stand for?
2. What is the syntax for writing HTML?
3. Explain what `<head>` and `<body>` are and what they should contain.
4. What are semantic elements, and why are they preferable to regular HTML elements?
5. What is the [DOM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dom-document-object-model/#)?

## Assignment

Your team will be making a website. You are free to choose a theme to base the website around. Some examples are magazines, sports, clubs, shows, etc.

### Index Page

The contents of this page are up to your discretion, but should involve work from each team member. This will
be the **landing page** of your website and should be made accordingly. This page should include:

- a title
- links to each individual page
- one or more images with alt text

### Individual Pages

Each member of your team should create their own page. This page should include:

- your name
- a title
- a link to the index page
- an ordered list
- an unordered list
- paragraphs
- headings
- a few images with alt text

## Submission

On Google Classroom, submit a link to your repo along with a drawing of the DOM tree for your `index.html` file. Your repo should
include a `README.md` that explains what your website is about. You can put your DOM tree there, if you would like.
